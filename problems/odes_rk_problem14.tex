\subsection*{Problem 13 — Runge–Kutta 4th Order (One Step)}

Consider the initial value problem

\[
y' = -2y + t, \qquad y(0) = 1.
\]

Use one step of the classical 4th-order Runge–Kutta method (RK4) with stepsize

\[
h = 0.1
\]

to approximate \(y(0.1)\).

Write out the values of \(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4\) and the final approximation \(y_1\).
