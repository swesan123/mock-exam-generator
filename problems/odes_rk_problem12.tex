\subsection*{Problem 11 — Trapezoidal Method on a Nonlinear ODE}

Consider the nonlinear ODE:

\[
y' = y^2.
\]

(a) Write the implicit trapezoidal method for this ODE.  

(b) Write the explicit trapezoidal (predictor–corrector) method.  

(c) Derive the nonlinear equation that must be solved for \(y_{i+1}\) in the implicit method.
