\subsection*{Problem 6 — Forward Euler Instability Demonstration}

Consider:

\[
y' = -10y,\qquad y(0)=1.
\]

(a) Using Forward Euler, write the recurrence relation.  

(b) Determine the stability bound for \(h\).  

(c) For \(h = 0.21\), compute the first three steps \(y_1, y_2, y_3\).  

(d) Explain why this step size leads to unstable growth or oscillation.
