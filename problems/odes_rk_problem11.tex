\subsection*{Problem 10 — Effect of Round-Off Error on IVPs}

Consider the IVP:

\[
x' = x,\qquad x(0)=c.
\]

Suppose the value of \(c\) is perturbed when read into the computer as \(\tilde{c}=c+\varepsilon\).  

(a) Determine the error at \(t=10\) and \(t=20\).  

(b) Repeat the analysis for the IVP:

\[
x' = -x.
\]
